        <h2>Flying: My Journey to Cloud Computing</h2>
        <p>Greetings AWS! I am Ikram, a Theology PhD candidate at the University of Oxford. I am an applicant for the Associate Solutions Architect Internship position at AWS. I decided to write this piece to document my motivations for this change in career direction.</p>
        <p>For as long as I can remember, I wanted to become a professor. I wanted to spend my life researching and teaching a subject I loved. I did my undergraduate at the LSE, a subsequent masters at Birmingham, leading me to a fully-funded scholarship to study at Oxford. </p>
        <p>Since joining Oxford, I have attended academic conferences, wrote papers for journal submission, refined my presentation technique and received training as a graduate teaching assistant. However, my career plans changed when I became a father! </p>
        <img class="ikramimage" src="IkramAsiya.jpg" width="330" height="330">
        <p> <<------ That's Asiyah, my daughter. Asiyah was born in July 2021 and her birth sparked a re-prioritisation of my life and ambitions. Becoming an early-stage academic would entail precarious contractual conditions, and I wanted more for my family. I conducted a SWOT analysis and researched careers that aligned with my wants. I wanted an intellectually challenging career that is client-facing and involves working closely in teams.</p>
        <p> I pursued commercial law for a few months, aggressively researching firms, attending law fairs, and networking with associates at elite city law firms. I landed two sought-after vacation schemes for the summer. However, the work-life balance commercial law offers (i.e., 10-12 hour working days as standard) never settled correctly in my heart. After all, I made this dramatic change of heart for my daughter. What use is a stable career for my daughter if I don't see my daughter!</p>
        <p>In searching for other options, I came across the role of a cloud solutions architect and cloud computing more generally, and I immediately fell in love. As a specialist in Islamic law and traditional studies, the possibilities of cloud solutions in aiding my research interests were immense. Specifically, utilising cloud infrastructure, machine learning and artificial intelligence to make accessible centuries of scholarship through manuscript verification, the historiography of foundational sources such as the Quran and Hadith and online repositories of Arabic books. Learning about these possibilities and building a career in this industry offered a genuine intellectual interest. The industry provides this alignment, calls upon intellectual challenges and problem solving, and more: work-life harmony! </p>
        <p>In late December 2021, I decided to start preparing for a career as a solutions architect. I have begun learning: the Linux OS and CLI, SQL, and Python. I have also started preparing for industry recognised certifications. Currently, I am revising for the AWS CCP exam to sit it in March 2022. I aspire to pass the AWS SAA certification by July 2022 and the Cisco 200-301 exam in August/September 2022. Despite having a PhD thesis to write, I am making these bold predictions because I am determined to obtain a graduate scheme as an associate solutions architect.</p>

                    I am a central organiser for the "Plaistow Residents Group", a quasi-pressure group set up to represent resident needs. Our group holds regular meetings with councillors and neighbourhood police on local issues. I am the communication lead for the group, focussing on bridging the informational gap between the local council and residents. Thus far, I have facilitated several resident feedback sessions on new council policies. Currently, the council is seeking community consultation on a major reinvestment in the local community. I am presently creating YouTube videos that explain the councilâ€™s four proposals in migrant languages: Bengali, Urdu, and Gujarati.

                <div>
                    I am the project lead for Darul Atfaal's Summer Scheme. Alongside their educational initiatives, Darul Atfaal organises trips and educational outings throughout the summer holidays for children aged 9-15. The Summer Scheme has been running since 2017; our cohorts average approximately 45-50 youngsters and we organise 18-20 trips per summer. Alongside Darul Atfaal's CEO, I envisioned this programme from inception. I organised most of the trips in that first year and leveraged our charity status to negotiate concession prices. I negotiated discounted prices, free meals, and even free equipment for some of the activities. For the second year, I created a full report on our activities with pictures, and we used this report to seek funding and sponsorship from the council and local businesses. In 2018 and 2019, I acted as project lead; I organised the trips and travel itinerary, negotiated prices, and managed the group of volunteers to fulfil each trip. I used Trello to streamline the entire workflow with the CEO.
